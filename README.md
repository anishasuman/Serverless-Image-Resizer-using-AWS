# 🚀 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Serverless Image Resizer Architecture** using AWS Services.  
When a user uploads an image to Amazon S3, a Lambda function automatically resizes the image and stores the resized version into another S3 bucket — fully automated, scalable, secure, and serverless.

---

# 🎯 Objectives  
- Fully automated image resizing pipeline  
- Use AWS Lambda for cost-efficient serverless execution  
- Store high-quality optimized images  
- Ensure scalable and event-driven architecture  
- Enforce secure access using IAM Roles & Policies  
- Low-latency content delivery (CloudFront)

# 🛠 AWS Services Used  
| AWS Service | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Amazon S3** | Store original & resized images |
| **AWS Lambda** | Resize images automatically |
| **AWS IAM** | Secure role-based permissions |
| **Amazon CloudWatch** | Logs, metrics, alarms |
| **Amazon CloudFront** | Optional fast image delivery |

---

# 🧩 Use Case / Scenario  
A CMS (Content Management System) receives large, high-resolution images.  
The website needs multiple versions — thumbnail, medium, large.  
Instead of manually resizing, the system resizes images automatically in the cloud.
